_Please click on the images on right side to view my solution._

The data is taken from the forecasting currency exchange rate on cost of living in indiviual country. The excel sheet have Big mac price and Hourly wages in USD Dollars from 27 countries.

1. Is there a relationship between the price of BigMac and the net hourly wages of workers around the world?
2. Is it possible to develop the model to predict or determine the net hourly wage of worker around the world by theprice of a BigMac in country. If so? how good is the model?
3. If a model can be constructed to determine the net hourly wages of a worker aroound the world by the price of BigMac, what would be the predicted net hourly wage of worker in a country, if the price of BigMac is $3.00?
